ðŸª©  add a dancing carrot or custom icon to an HTML element, tiny js library used for dialogue boxes in https://oogycanyouhelp.com

ðŸš€ Try the live example here on Github Pages! [https://insanj.github.io/dancing/example/](https://insanj.github.io/dancing/example/)

## Install

Built with Typescript, compiled for use in any modern browser through the `OogyDancing.min.js` file.

```js
import { OogyDancing } from "OogyDancing.min.js";
```

```html
<script src="OogyDancing.min.js"></script>
```

For development or Node.js use:

```bash
npm install oogy-dancing
```


## Usage

To learn how to use this module, check out [OogyDancing.ts](src/OogyDancing.ts), which is full of documentation and comments about how to use the API and what its full capabilities are.

See [example/](example/) as well as the `package.json` command `npm run example` for a demo of it in action. Below, a snippet of the example's [index.html](example/index.html):

```html
<script type="module">

  import { 
    OogyDancing
  } from "/dist/OogyDancing.min.js";

  const element = document.getElementById("dialogue"); // make sure this element has position: relative (or its parent, or one of its children)
  const text = "Hello, Github! This is oogy-dancing, a simple but powerful tool for web-based video games.";

  element.textContent = text;
  
  const dancer = new OogyDancing.OogyDancer();
  dancer.attach(element);

  console.log("oogy-dancing example has started its dance", dancer, element);

</script>
```

The default options are currently:

```js
export const kOogyDancingOptionsDefault: OogyDancingOptions = {
  kind: OogyDancingKind.carrot,
  duration: 500,
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  distance: 10,
  horizontal: OogyDancingAlign.end,
  horizontalInset: 0,
  vertical: OogyDancingAlign.end,
  verticalInset: 20
}
```

## Development

To begin development on this module, clone the repo and run `npm install` to grab all the needed development dependencies. Then, use `npm start` to turn the `src/*.ts` -> `dist/*.js`, then use `npm run release` to turn the `.js` to `.min.js`. See `package.json` to learn how these scripts work.

It can be helpful to make sure your IDE is using the same Typescript version as `package.json`. For example, in Visual Studio Code, open a `.ts` file and use the shortcut SHIFT+COMMAND+P and choose `TypeScript: > Select TypeScript Version...`.
